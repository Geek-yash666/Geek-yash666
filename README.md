# 🙋‍♂️ About me!

I'm **Roop Yaswanth** (he/him), a passionate master's student majoring in **Applied Data Science** at the [Department of Engineering Education](https://www.eng.ufl.edu/eed/) at the University of Florida 🐊.

Proficient in Python, utilizing libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn to build machine learning models I'm deeply fascinated by the world of **data science** and **machine learning** 🤖. I enjoy diving into complex topics like probability, statistics, and linear algebra, which are essential tools in unlocking insights from data 📊.

My journey in technology is driven by curiosity and a constant desire to learn and grow 📚. I'm particularly interested in:

- **Artificial Intelligence** and its applications in solving real-world problems 🌐
- **Data Science**, utilizing advanced techniques to extract meaningful insight and drive decision-making 🧠
- **Data Analysis** and visualization to tell compelling stories with data 📈
- **Collaborative Projects** that make a positive impact on society 🤝

I’ve been fortunate to apply my skills in exciting projects like:

* [**Readr**]() 📚: A MERN-based bookstore platform for seamless buying and user management.
* [**RagCart**]() 🚗: A dynamic car rental system built with Java Servlets and MongoDB.

I'm eager to engage with the tech community, exchange ideas, and collaborate on innovative projects that challenge the status quo 🚀.
